\section*{Profile}
Frontend Web Engineer with 9+ years' experience building and scaling e-commerce and SaaS platforms. Skilled in React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and modern frontend tooling. I've worked across the stack, modernised legacy systems, and mentored teams---but I'm also a tinkerer at heart. Whether it's streamlining analytics for millions of users or building out a SaaS app from scratch, I like solving problems and making things that actually work.
